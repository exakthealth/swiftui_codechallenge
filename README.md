# SwiftUI Code Challenge

The main goal of this challenge is to get a general idea of your knowledge around SwiftUI. The challenge is small, it shouldn't take more than 1h. 

We are providing the skeleton of a small app that allows the user to see a list of "items" in two different ways: in a new screen and in an overlay view. Here's is what you have to do:

1. Fork the project, it will work as a template to start the challenge.
2. You will find an existing entry point for the "Challenge app", composed by ContentView and a ViewModel. 
    - ContenView -> It has two buttons with their actions empty. Your task is to fill out these actions to navigate to a new screen and show an overlay view respectively.
    - ViewModel -> It provides the data to show. Feel free to use it if you need it for any other purposes. In this file, you will also find the models you need to use, but you can make any change that fits for your solution.
3. The goal is to show the information as displayed in the following image. It should be shown in a new screen or in an overlay view depending on which button was pressed.

Hint: Specific colors, typographies, and other minor visual details are irrelevant. What we want to see is how you handle navigation and how you structure your views in the code.
